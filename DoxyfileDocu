# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "docs.depage.net"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          = "Depage Documentation"

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included
# in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55
# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = www/lib/global/icon-depagecms.svg

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT = README.md

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page
# (index.html). This can be useful if you have a project on for instance GitHub
# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the doxygen output.

USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE = README.md

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = Docs/

# The HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify additional user-defined
# cascading style sheets that are included after the standard style sheets
# created by doxygen. Using this option one can overrule certain style aspects.
# This is preferred over using HTML_STYLESHEET since it does not replace the
# standard style sheet and is therefore more robust against future updates.
# Doxygen will copy the style sheet files to the output directory.
# Note: The order of the extra style sheet files is of importance (e.g. the last
# style sheet in the list overrules the setting of the previous ones in the
# list).
# Note: Since the styling of scrollbars can currently not be overruled in
# Webkit/Chromium, the styling will be left out of the default doxygen.css if
# one or more extra stylesheets have been specified. So if scrollbar
# customization is desired it has to be added explicitly. For an example see the
# documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# To get valid HTML the header file that includes any scripts and style sheets
# that doxygen needs, which is dependent on the configuration options used (e.g.
# the setting GENERATE_TREEVIEW). It is highly recommended to start with a
# default header using
# doxygen -w html new_header.html new_footer.html new_stylesheet.css
# YourConfigFile
# and then modify the file new_header.html. See also section "Doxygen usage"
# for information on how to generate the default header that doxygen normally
# uses.
# Note: The header is subject to change so you typically have to regenerate the
# default header when upgrading to a newer version of doxygen. For a description
# of the possible markers and block names see the documentation.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_HEADER            = www/header.html

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML footer for each
# generated HTML page. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a standard
# footer. See HTML_HEADER for more information on how to generate a default
# footer and what special commands can be used inside the footer. See also
# section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to generate the default footer
# that doxygen normally uses.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_FOOTER            = www/footer.html

# When the TOC_INCLUDE_HEADINGS tag is set to a non-zero value, all headings up
# to that level are automatically included in the table of contents, even if
# they do not have an id attribute.
# Note: This feature currently applies only to Markdown headings.
# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 99, default value: 5.
# This tag requires that the tag MARKDOWN_SUPPORT is set to YES.

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
